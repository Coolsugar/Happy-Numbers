# Happy Numbers
The purpose of this project was to determine the density of happy numbers among natural numbers. The attached script is capable of generating happy numbers infinitely. The attached data file has the list of happy numbers upto 10 million generated using this script. The density computed was 14.18%. 

[Justin Gilmer wrote a paper]([url](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3836)) in 2011 that proves that happy numbers have an upper density of at least 18% and a lower density of at most 12%. 
According to CORE, happy numbers have a lower density of 0.1138 and an upper density of 0.18577. However, Scientific American Blogs says that the asymptotic density of happiness does not exist. Wikipedia says that the 10-happy numbers do not have an asymptotic density.
